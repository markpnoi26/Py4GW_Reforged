# PyListeners stub - Reforged Native surface.
# Exact counterpart of src/listeners/listeners_bindings.cpp.
#
# Runtime toggles for the native game-event listeners. A listener is a named unit
# over a set of native callbacks (StoC packets, a UI hook, or a poll tick) whose
# only job is to be switched on or off: enable installs the callbacks, disable
# removes them (both idempotent), so a disabled listener has zero overhead.
#
# Registered names (see include/listeners/listeners.h):
#   "merchant"                   - quoted price / transaction / window item capture (on by default)
#   "agent_events"               - per-agent event ring buffer (on by default)
#   "skill_list_filter"          - hide known / non-elite skills in skill windows (opt-in)
#   "signet_of_capture_limit"    - clamp Signet of Capture count to 10 (opt-in)
#   "faction_warning"            - warn when earned faction reaches a % of the cap (opt-in)
#   "cinematic_skip"             - auto-skip in-game cinematics (opt-in)
#   "auto_return_on_defeat"      - leader returns party to outpost on wipe (opt-in)
#   "disable_gold_confirmation"  - remove gold/green item sell confirmation (opt-in)
#   "remove_cast_bar_minimum"    - show cast bar for very short casts (opt-in)
#   "auto_cancel_ua"             - drop Unyielding Aura before recasting it (opt-in)
#   "auto_open_locked_chest"     - auto-send use-key / use-lockpick at a locked chest (opt-in)
#   "faction_donate_skip_name"   - prefill character name when donating faction (opt-in)
#   "keep_current_quest"         - keep manually-chosen quest when a new one is added (opt-in)
#   "skip_campaign_prompt"       - auto-confirm the another-campaign mission-entry prompt (opt-in)
#
# Every toggle is addressed by name and returns False when the name is unknown.
# The set_*/get_* config functions below target a specific listener directly; a
# listener must still be enabled by name for its config to take effect.
